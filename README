HTML::Calendar::Monthly

This is a very simple module which will make an HTML representation of
a given month. You can add links to individual days.

Yes, the inspiration for this came out of me looking at
HTML::Calendar::Simple, and thinking 'Hmmm. A bit too complicated for
what I want. I know, I will write a simplified version.' So I did.

Along with the module comes a flexible program to generate monthly
calendars for inclusion in web sites.
